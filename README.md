## Unity Part

To avoid any merge error caused by different Unity versions, I hope everyone use the same version of Unity.

The version we are going to use is **2018.8.4f1**, please install this version and open the project with this version.

For the developers, you will use C# in Unity. This [manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html) will be handy while you are learning how to use Unity.

## GitHub Part

#### How to get the project from GitHub to your PC

1. Register yourself a GitHub account.
2. Install GitHub Desktop in [this link](https://desktop.github.com/). Sometimes there are bugs but it's pretty easy to use for people who knows nothing about Node.js like me.
3. Find a green button called "Clone or download" in this page, click it and copy the link.
4. Go to GitHub Desktop that you just installed and sign in.
5. **I haven't create the empty Unity project yet but you can still do this step. But there will be no Unity project downloaded to your PC at this point.** Go to File -> Clone repository -> URL, paste the link you just copied and choose a local path.
6. It will do its job automatically, wait a sec and then you have the project in your PC, you can open it with your Unity.

#### The things that usually go wrong

* Be super careful before you **push** the project

The action PUSH will overwrite the cloud with your local changes. Indeed, you can rollback the things in GitHub but it's quiet annoying to do so. So if you just want to check the project instead of editing it, you should never push.

There's another way to solve this issue, which is make a own branch. In GitHub Desktop, click on "Current branch", you can type a name for your new branch and click on "New branch" button. This makes a copy of the master branch into a separate branch, so you can work in your own branch. When you get your work in this branch done, you can merge it back to the master branch.

There are not a lot to say at this moment, I will add more when they come into my mind.
